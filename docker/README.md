# Docker

This directory provides the user with a method to quickly build and test the
drone code.  Scripts are provided to create the docker image and to start and
stop the container.

NOTE: running the simulation requires a graphics card with 4GB RAM or better.

## Basic operation

NOTES:
The code repo is outside the docker and is mounted on to `/home/user/`.
